# Mountain-Car-Problem-RL
On the OpenAI Gym website, the Mountain Car problem is described as follows:

A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two “mountains”. 

The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car’s engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum
